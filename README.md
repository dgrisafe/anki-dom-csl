# anki-dom-csl

Create a custom [Citation Style Language (CSL)](https://citationstyles.org/) that will work with Anki html files.

I want the citation titles to be html <a> tags that will be clickable in Anki cards.

# Template by A. Cromba

I used as a template [A minimal citation style (for grant proposals)](https://anton.cromba.ch/2016/02/07/a-minimal-citation-stylefor-grant-proposals/) by Anton Cromba.

# Cmd+Shift+C in Zotero

Press `Cmd`+`Shift`+`C` while highlighting one or more references in Zotero.

Then paste from the clipboard into the References field of Anki (in the html field).

This will create a clean format for references, which may be consistently used across cards.
